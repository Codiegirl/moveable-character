## Instructions:
We're going to make our character move on it's own from within the chrome console!
* First, open up index.html in chrome. Open up your console, and then write `walkRight()`. Write `stop()` to stop the character from moving.
* Next, open up index.js, and try to understand how the code works.
* Finally, used what you've learned to finish the methods for our character to move in the remaining directions.
